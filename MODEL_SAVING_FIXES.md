# Model Saving Fixes for Wavelet Fusion Options 1 & 2

## Issues Fixed

### Option 1 (trainable_wavelet_fusion_training.ipynb)
- ✅ **Enhanced model saving**: Added comprehensive checkpoint information including epoch metrics, learned alpha parameters, and model configuration
- ✅ **Added periodic checkpoints**: Model saves every 10 epochs with full training history
- ✅ **Improved best model tracking**: Better tracking of best validation loss and corresponding epoch
- ✅ **Added training history saving**: Complete training metrics saved separately for analysis

### Option 2 (trainable_wavelet_fusion_option2.ipynb)
- ✅ **Added final model checkpoint**: Ensures model is saved even if last epoch isn't the best
- ✅ **Enhanced checkpoint structure**: Comprehensive model and training information

### Test Files
- ✅ **Option 1 Test (test_wavelet_fusion_model_option_1.ipynb)**: 
  - Added missing `WaveletFusionNet` model definition
  - Fixed model loading to handle both old and new checkpoint formats
  - Added better error handling and information display
  
- ✅ **Option 2 Test (test_wavelet_fusion_model_option_2.ipynb)**:
  - Fixed checkpoint path handling
  - Improved model loading with better error messages
  - Added checkpoint structure guidance

## New Checkpoint Structure

### Option 1: `checkpoints_wavelet/`
```
checkpoints_wavelet/
├── wavelet_fusion_best.pt           # Best model based on validation loss
├── wavelet_fusion_epoch_10.pt       # Checkpoint every 10 epochs
├── wavelet_fusion_epoch_20.pt
├── ...
└── training_history.pt              # Complete training metrics
```

### Option 2: `checkpoints_enhanced/`
```
checkpoints_enhanced/
├── wavelet_fusion_spatial_best.pt   # Best model based on total loss
├── wavelet_fusion_spatial_final.pt  # Final model state
├── wavelet_fusion_spatial_epoch_5.pt # Checkpoint every 5 epochs
├── wavelet_fusion_spatial_epoch_10.pt
├── ...
└── training_history.pt              # Complete training metrics
```

## Checkpoint Contents

Each checkpoint now contains:
- `epoch`: Training epoch number
- `model_state_dict`: Complete model parameters
- `optimizer_state_dict`: Optimizer state for resuming training
- `best_loss`/`best_val_loss`: Best achieved loss
- `epoch_metrics`: Complete training history
- `model_config`: Model configuration including:
  - Model type
  - Wavelet type
  - Loss weights
  - Learned parameters (for Option 1)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Training**: Run the training notebooks to train and save models
   - Option 1: `trainable_wavelet_fusion_training.ipynb`
   - Option 2: `trainable_wavelet_fusion_option2.ipynb`

2. **Testing**: Use the corresponding test notebooks to load and evaluate models
   - Option 1: `test_wavelet_fusion_model_option_1.ipynb`
   - Option 2: `test_wavelet_fusion_model_option_2.ipynb`

3. **Model Loading**: Test notebooks now automatically handle checkpoint loading with proper error messages if models aren't found

## Features Added

- **Robust checkpoint saving**: Models saved with comprehensive information
- **Training resumption**: Can resume training from any checkpoint
- **Better error handling**: Clear messages when models aren't found
- **Training visualization**: Automatic plotting of training curves
- **Model information display**: Shows learned parameters and training details

## Notes

- The models will only be available after running the training notebooks
- Make sure the dataset paths are correct before training
- Checkpoints are saved in separate directories to avoid conflicts
- Training history is saved separately for detailed analysis
